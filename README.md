So here is a repo with all the assets needed for your test assignment. The assignment consists of the several subtasks:

1. Find a getGroupsPage request in the /api directory and fetch test server data and build parse in into a table. The table should obtain pagination logic.
   (You may use pre-ready components from the /components directory, but there will be a huge + if you try do it yourself:) )

2. Add another column to the table, each cell of the column should contain a dropdown with arbitrary options (put there whatever you want). Again you may use a component form the /components directory, or try to create your own one.

3. Well done! However, as you could have noticed there is a one nasty problem in our UI. When the user opens a dropdown all the other ones stay opened. We need to close all the previously opened dropdowns on every dropdown click. Good luck!
